# PyBdEcho
An audio demonstration using [MicroPython], the [PyBoard] and its [AMP Skin].

For a discussion of the application and its development refer to my
EuroPython [presentation] in Rimini, July 2017.

## Construction
You need good soldering skills to build the [AMP skin].
Once built you'll be able to access the speaker
using DAC port 1 and the microphone on ADC X22.
