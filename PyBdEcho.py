The PyBoard 'Echo' audio capture/playback demonstration code.
v1.0.1 was presented at EuroPython, Rimini, July 2017. This application
requires MicroPython (tested with v1.9.1), PyBoard v1.1 and the
AMP Audio skin v1.0.

The entry point is `echo()`, which simply invokes `_init()` followed by
`_capture_play_loop()`.
